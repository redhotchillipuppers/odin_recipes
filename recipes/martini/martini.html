      <h3>Lets make a martini</h3>
      <img src="./martini.jpg" alt="Picture of a passionfruit martini">
      <p>The sweet and sour combination of vanilla vodka, passion fruit liqueur, 
        freshly squeezed lime juice and a simple vanilla syrup makes this party classic 
        unique and delicious.

      </p> <!-- p declares a paragraph, strong makes it bold-->
      <p>You will need</p>
      <strong>For the syrup</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>100G caster sugar</li>
        <li>50ml oz water</li>
        <li>10ml vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>For the cocktail</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>2 handfuls ice</li>
        <li>2 passion fruit</li>
        <li>50ml vanilla vodka</li>
        <li>15ml passionfruit liqueur</li>
        <li>15ml lime juice</li>
        <li>50ml prosecco</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Method</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>For the vanilla syrup, put the caster sugar in a small non-stick saucepan over 
          a medium heat then pour in the water and vanilla extract. Stir and bring to the 
          boil. CAUTION: boiling sugar is extremely hot. Handle very carefully. Use a deep 
          pan to avoid bubbling over.

        </li>
        <li>Once the sugar has dissolved and the liquid is clear, take the pan off the heat 
          and leave to cool. Put a coupette or other glass of your choice into the freezer.

        </li>
        <li>Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Halve the passionfruit, scoop out the insides 
          of one and a half and add them to the shaker. Pour 10ml/2 teaspoons of the cooled 
          vanilla syrup over the ice along with the vodka, liqueur and lime juice. Shake 
          vigorously for 8-10 seconds.

        </li>
        <li>Strain the mixture into the chilled coupette using a hawthorne cocktail strainer 
          and a fine mesh strainer. If you donâ€™t have a strainer, any kitchen sieve will 
          work just as well.

        </li>
        <li>Float the remaining passionfruit half on top of the drink and serve the Prosecco 
          on the side. We recommend pouring the Prosecco into the passionfruit martini once 
          served!

        </li>
